# unraidclaw

> OpenClaw plugin to manage your Unraid server through AI agents: Docker, VMs, array, shares, system, notifications, and more, with permission control.

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/unraidclaw)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unraidclaw)

This is the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) plugin for **[UnraidClaw](https://github.com/emaspa/unraidclaw)**. It exposes **63 tools** to any AI agent running on OpenClaw, letting it monitor and manage your Unraid server. The plugin talks to the UnraidClaw gateway (a permission-enforcing REST API) running on your Unraid box.

## Prerequisites

1. **The UnraidClaw plugin installed on your Unraid server.** Install it from the Unraid Community Apps store, or see the [main repo](https://github.com/emaspa/unraidclaw). It runs the gateway on port `9876` (HTTPS) by default.
2. **An UnraidClaw API key.** Generate one on the **Settings > UnraidClaw** page in the Unraid WebGUI.
3. **OpenClaw** installed (`openclaw --version`).

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:unraidclaw --accept-capabilities
```

The same package is on npm. OpenClaw asks you to confirm installs from outside ClawHub, so installing from npm needs `--force`:

```bash
openclaw plugins install unraidclaw --force --accept-capabilities
```

To update to the latest version:

```bash
openclaw plugins update unraidclaw --accept-capabilities
```

Then restart the gateway with `openclaw gateway restart` so it loads the new version.

## Configure

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

**Single server:**

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["unraidclaw"],
    "entries": {
      "unraidclaw": {
        "config": {
          "serverUrl": "https://YOUR_UNRAID_IP:9876",
          "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
          "tlsSkipVerify": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Multiple servers:**

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["unraidclaw"],
    "entries": {
      "unraidclaw": {
        "config": {
          "servers": [
            { "name": "home", "serverUrl": "https://<home-server>:9876", "apiKey": "<api-key>", "tlsSkipVerify": true, "default": true },
            { "name": "work", "serverUrl": "https://<work-server>:9876", "apiKey": "<api-key>" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With multi-server config, every tool accepts an optional `server` parameter (e.g. `unraid_docker_list(server: "work")`); the first server marked `default` is used when it's omitted, or the first configured server if none is marked.

Set `tlsSkipVerify: true` to accept the gateway's self-signed certificate. The plugin does not verify the certificate in that mode, so regenerating the certificate on the server does not affect it. The repository README's [TLS certificate](https://github.com/emaspa/unraidclaw#tls-certificate) section explains what the certificate contains and how strict clients can trust it.

### Keeping the API key out of the config file

You don't have to hard-code the key in `openclaw.json`. Two options:

**Environment variable.** OpenClaw expands `${VAR}` references at config-load time:

```json
"apiKey": "${UNRAID_API_KEY}"
```

**Provider-backed secret (`SecretRef`).** Point `apiKey` at one of your configured secret providers; OpenClaw resolves it before the plugin loads, so the plugin only ever sees the resolved string:

```json
"apiKey": { "source": "file", "provider": "default", "id": "/unraidclaw_key" }
```

`source` is one of `file`, `env`, or `exec`; `provider` names a provider from your `secrets.providers` config; `id` is the lookup key. Both forms also work per-server on `servers[].apiKey`. (Requires unraidclaw 0.1.12+.)

## Usage

Once installed and configured, ask your agent:

- "List all running Docker containers"
- "Stop the plex container"
- "What's the array status?"
- "Show me disk temperatures"
- "Create a new nginx container with port 8080"
- "Find me a Community Applications backup tool"
- "Install Jellyfin from Community Applications, media on /mnt/user/media"
- "Update the jellyfin container to the latest image"
- "Which of my Unraid plugins have updates?"
- "Check parity status"
- "Reboot the server"

`unraid_ca_install` takes `full: true` to install an app with every setting its template asks for, including privileged mode, Extra Parameters, devices and custom networks, plus optional `settings` such as a network and fixed IP. A full install needs the Edit & Rebuild permission.

`unraid_ca_update` and `unraid_ca_remove` act on an installed app, so their `name` is the container's name from the Docker tab, not the app's name in the catalog. Update keeps the configuration saved on the server and restores the running or stopped state; remove deletes the container and leaves appdata, volumes, the image and the template alone. Both take `dryRun`.

`unraid_template_get` reads an installed container's saved settings, and `unraid_template_edit` changes them and rebuilds the container the way the Docker tab's Apply does: ports, paths, variables, labels, devices, network and fixed IP, privileged mode, Extra Parameters and Tailscale. The rebuilt container must start and stay up, or the original comes back and its template is left unchanged. It changes settings, not the app version. It takes `dryRun`.

`unraid_app_request` sends one request to an installed app's own web API, for changes inside the app such as an Immich album or a proxy host. The server finds the container's address itself and adds the key the user saved on the App Keys tab without ever showing it. `unraid_app_list` shows which apps have a key. Changes take `dryRun`.

The four compose tools manage Docker Compose stacks. Stacks deployed from a git checkout can only be started, stopped and restarted, since their repository is the source; local stacks can also be edited and redeployed, with a backup and a rollback when a service does not come back. Secrets in compose files are shown as `***` and kept when sent back that way.

The six plugin tools manage Unraid `.plg` plugins through Unraid's own plugin manager. Installing one runs vendor code as root, checking for an update downloads a plugin file and stages it, and removing one runs the plugin's removal script, which may take its data with it. All four mutating tools take `dryRun`.

Tools use the gateway's 36-key `resource:action` permission matrix configured from the Unraid WebGUI. Health requires no permission.

## Gateway MCP mode

The gateway has an optional MCP endpoint at `/mcp` that serves the same 63 tools to MCP clients. It is off by default and is switched on with **Enable MCP** in the gateway's Settings tab. This plugin does not use it: OpenClaw keeps calling `/api/*` whether MCP is on or off. The tool definitions in this package are shared with the gateway through the `unraidclaw/tools` export, so OpenClaw, MCP and the standalone CLI use the same tools and the `READ_ONLY` set exported by `src/registry.ts`. The CLI, command `unraidclaw`, is published to npm as `unraidclaw-cli` and attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/emaspa/unraidclaw/releases/latest) as `unraidclaw-cli-<version>.tar.gz`; see the [CLI guide](https://github.com/emaspa/unraidclaw/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md). See the [repository README](https://github.com/emaspa/unraidclaw#mcp) for MCP client setup.
